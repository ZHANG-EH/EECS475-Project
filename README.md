# eecs475-project

## Proposal
We are going to build a software that implements the Substring-Searchable
Symmetric Encryption. Further, in the software we will simulate a client-and-server
interaction where client queries a string and server returns the result using this
encryption scheme. Further, We will discuss the efficiency and security of this encryption.

The encryption we will implement is based on this [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/638.pdf
).
